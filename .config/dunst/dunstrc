monitor = 0

# Display notification on focused monitor.  Possible modes are:
#   mouse: follow mouse pointer
#   keyboard: follow window with keyboard focus

#
# "keyboard" needs a windowmanager that exports the
# _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW property.
# This should be the case for almost all modern windowmanagers.
#
# If this option is set to mouse or keyboard, the monitor option
# will be ignored.
