# My dotfiles and initial configuration

This repository contains my configuration files. I use them on a Manjaro architect installation with the bspwm DE.

In order to use it, clone the repo and run `install.sh`. It will install repos from the repositories and AUR and create symbolic links to config files and directories at the appropriate places.
